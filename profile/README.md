# WayBionic

**Calgary-based student project team building a bionic robotic arm for remote/teleoperated surgery — inspired by the challenges of operating in space.**

Our goal is to design reliable, precise tools that help clinicians perform procedures from afar—useful in extreme environments (like orbit) and here on Earth. We’re a multidisciplinary group of students collaborating across engineering and biomedical domains to turn that mission into reality.

## What we do
- **Robotic arm R&D:** embedded firmware, control software, electronics, and system integration  
- **Safety & reliability:** motion limits, networking resilience, and human-in-the-loop control  
- **Applied research:** adapting teleoperation concepts to surgical use-cases

## Get involved
We’re actively recruiting students who are curious, collaborative, and eager to learn.
